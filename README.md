# exportcalendar
a c# application for export Exchange user calendar information via EWS

Application account must have impersonation permission . If you do not provide any custom account during run it will use currently logged user account .

CSV file must be single column (email address) like ;

Or you can get single mailbox calendar information (press set after type the user account) .
